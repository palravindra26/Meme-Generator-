## Meme Generator

This is a web application built with React.js and JavaScript that allows users to create and share memes. It utilizes the ImgFlip API for extracting memes, Firebase for authentication and database functionalities, and provides features like sign-in/login, unique URLs for each meme, and a gallery of saved memes.

### Features

 - *Sign In / Login*: Users can create accounts, sign in, and log in to the application. Firebase authentication is used to securely handle user credentials.
 - *Unique URL for each meme*: When a user creates a meme, it is assigned a unique URL that can be shared with others. This allows users to easily access and view specific memes directly.
 - *Saved Memes Gallery*: All the memes created and saved by a user are visible in a gallery. Users can easily browse through their created memes and share

To run locally :
```
npm i
npm start
```

Note : I used [ImgFlip API](https://imgflip.com/api) to both extract all the memes. For Authentication and Database I use Firebase.
